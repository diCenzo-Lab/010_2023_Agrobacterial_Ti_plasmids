The scripts in this repository allow for classification of agrobacterial Ti plasmids into the categories described by Weisberg et al. (2020, 2022), using the strategy outlined in Kuzmanović et al. (2023). To run the classification, you should use the command `sh Ti_Ri_plasmid_classification.sh directory/ threads`, where *directory* is a directory containing the fasta files of all plasmids to be analyzed, and *threads* is the number of threads to use to multithreaded steps. If you use these scripts or adaptations of them as part of your work, please cite Kuzmanović et al. (2023).
